      <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is often defined as a computer that can think
         like a human. This has raised many concerns that computers will one day
         overthrow our society and take control, but it is not like that at all.
         Artificial Intelliegence is used to increase the chances of success in
         a system. John McCarthy was the one to coin the term Artificial Intelligence
         as an effort to distinguish his field from that of cybernetics. Because of the 
         work of McCarthy and his open-source code for LISP, artificial intelligence
         has been able to be used in many places that we would never expect.</p>
      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>As many people think that Artificial Intelligence will be the downfall of
         our society by either causing mass unemployment or a revolution of computers
         that are smarter than man. This is not the case however. artificial intelligence
         is often used to make our lives easier. In recent years companies like
         Space X use artificial intelligence to help land their Falcon rockets, even down to
         targeted advertisements. These ads can feel like a breach of privacy by using your
         search history to find products that you would be likely to end up purchasing.
         As long as our society does not allow for artificial intelligence to reach a 
         state where is is not only smarter than humans, but can also find the means
         to overthrow us.</p>
