      <p class="list">John McCarthy was an American mathematician and computer
        scientist. McCarthy mostly studied the formalization of common-sense
        knowledge. Eventually McCarthy and his team would develop the programming
        language known as LISP, a language used primarily by the AI community. </p>
      <p class="list">Hailed as one of the "founding fathers" of A.I. McCarthy 
        worked with the likes of ALan Turing, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester
        and Claude E. Shannon to coin the term artificial Intelligence. Around the
        late 1950s, McCarthy would develop LISP as well as three of the earliest time
        sharing systems, which was eventually known as servers, then the cloud.</p>
