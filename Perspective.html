      <h2>Perspective</h2>
      <p>As Artificial Intelligence becomes smarter and smarter our society becomes
         more and more afraid of it. I, for one, am excited to see where artificial
         intelligence will take or society. Because of John McCarthy's contributions
         to the field of computer science computer, programmers took advantage of LISP
         to improve upon their own creations. As time goes on and our socitey continues
         to develop artificial intelligence will have a more pivitol role in how we
         function as well as how we develop. </p>
